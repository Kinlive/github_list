# GitHub List

The project shows the profiles of GitHub members form identity number 1 to 100 by [API of get-all-users](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users). In addition to avatar and the login name of user, it can be seen clearly that if he/she is an administrator.

On the other hand, the project is written by Swift and MVVM Architecture. In order to separate view and data more obviously and reduce the heavy burden of controller. MVVM's view-model plays an extremely important role in the process. It is a safer and more effective way to develop software applications.
